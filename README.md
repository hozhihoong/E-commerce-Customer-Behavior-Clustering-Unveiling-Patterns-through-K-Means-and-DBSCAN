# E-commerce-Customer-Behavior-Clustering-Unveiling-Patterns-through-K-Means-and-DBSCAN
- Clustered customer behavior in an ecommerce dataset using k-means and DBSCAN.
- Implemented k-means (centroid-based) and DBCAN (density-based) for clustering.
- Visualized clusters using 2D and 3D scatter plots for both methods.
- Analyzed centroid features to describe each cluster.
- Evaluated clustering quality between k-means and DBSCAN with Silhouette Score.
